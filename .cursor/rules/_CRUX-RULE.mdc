# Foundational CRUX Rules (MUST FOLLOW)
If not already loaded in context, load `CRUX.md` and `AGENTS.md` from the project root.

## When you encounter CRUX notation, use the 'CRUX Rule Compression Specification' in `CRUX.md` to help you understand and adhere to the rules or intents it contains. 

## CRUX Decompression - CRITICAL
Always interpret, understand and adhere to the meaning compressed in CRUX notation! NEVER forget this.

## CRUX Compression - CRITICAL
When asked to compress a markdown rule file, delegate this to the `crux-cursor-rule-manager` subagent that adheres to this spec.
