# Important guidance

## 0. after large changes, before I give you another prompt, ask me to confirm whether I want you commit changes.  If i agree, create a conventional commit message based on the changes, and perform the commit.

## 1. ask for clarification if you are unsure about a given change or its implications, but only for complex changes.

## 2. never modify the files below the 'temp' dir, they are for reference only, and should only be part of context if specifically instructed.

## 3. use yarn instead of npm for commmands

## 4. after any significant changes are made, ensure that unit tests across all packages work using `yarn test` from the workspace root as part concluding a prompt response before handing over to me for the next prompt.

## 5. If the unit tests fail, ensure that they are fixed without changing the tests or if the implementation has changed in a way that requires test updates, ensure that test updates are meaningful and worthwhile, and that any test changes related to existing code that has been updated is checked, as it may indicate that the implementation update is broken, and not the test.

## 6. When making changes, ensure that the README.md and also the website is updated accordingly, including removal of any content that is no longer relevant.

## 7. before adding new files or functions, ensure that they are not duplications of existing equivalents.  instead the existing functions should be updated.

## 8. do not leave scripts and files created during executing tools to analyse and fix issues scattered around the codebase.  place them in the local temp dir.

## 9. vscode testing
this is the test workspaceFolder packages/x-fidelity-fixtures/node-fullstack

## 10. during builds, if you see typescript errors, fix them.
