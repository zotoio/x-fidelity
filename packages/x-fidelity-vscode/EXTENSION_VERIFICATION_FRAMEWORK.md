## 🚨 Troubleshooting Verification Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Extension doesn't activate:**
1. Check Output panel: `View > Output > X-Fidelity`
2. Look for TypeScript compilation errors
3. Verify dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Rebuild: `yarn dev:build`

**Commands not visible:**
1. Try `Developer: Reload Window`
2. Check Command Palette for "X-Fidelity" prefix
3. Verify package.json contributes section
4. Check extension activation events

**F5 debugging not working:**
1. Ensure VSCode is in extension directory
2. Check `.vscode/launch.json` exists
3. Verify TypeScript builds successfully
4. Try `yarn dev:fresh` for clean profile

**Tests failing:**
1. Run `yarn build:test` first
2. Check for async test issues
3. Verify mock configurations
4. Run tests individually to isolate issues

## 📈 Performance Verification

### Benchmarks
