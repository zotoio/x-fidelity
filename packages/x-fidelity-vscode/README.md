# X-Fidelity VSCode Extension

This is the VSCode extension for X-Fidelity, providing architectural analysis directly within your code editor.

## Development

### Quick Start

From the workspace root, you can use these convenient commands:

```bash
# Build and launch extension in debug mode
yarn vscode:dev

# Build and launch with fresh user data (clean state)
yarn vscode:dev:fresh

# Build, launch, and watch for changes
yarn vscode:dev:watch

# Package the extension for distribution
yarn vscode:package
```

### Local Development Scripts

From within the `packages/x-fidelity-vscode` directory:

```bash
# Build the extension
yarn build

# Build and launch in debug mode
yarn dev

# Build and launch with fresh VSCode instance
yarn dev:fresh

# Build, launch, and watch for changes
yarn dev:watch

# Watch for changes (without launching VSCode)
yarn watch

# Package for distribution
yarn package

# Clean build artifacts
yarn clean

# Run tests
yarn test
```

### VSCode Development Workflow

#### Option 1: Command Line (Recommended for quick testing)

```bash
# From workspace root
yarn vscode:dev
```

This will:
1. Clean previous builds
2. Build all dependencies
3. Build the extension
4. Launch a new VSCode window with the extension loaded

#### Option 2: VSCode Debug (Recommended for debugging)

1. Open this workspace in VSCode
2. Go to Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)
3. Select "Run X-Fidelity Extension"
4. Press F5 or click the play button

This will:
1. Build the extension automatically
2. Launch the Extension Development Host
3. Allow you to set breakpoints and debug

#### Option 3: Watch Mode (Recommended for active development)

```bash
# From workspace root
yarn vscode:dev:watch
```

This will:
1. Build and launch the extension
2. Continue watching for file changes
3. Automatically rebuild when files change
4. You can reload the Extension Development Host (Ctrl+R) to see changes

### Extension Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Automatically analyzes your code as you work
- **Inline Diagnostics**: Shows issues directly in the editor with squiggly lines
- **Problems Panel**: Integrates with VSCode's Problems panel
- **Report Generation**: Creates detailed reports in multiple formats
- **Status Bar**: Shows analysis status and quick actions
- **Command Palette**: Access all features via Ctrl+Shift+P
- **Configuration**: Extensive settings for customization

### Commands

Access these commands via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):

- `X-Fidelity: Run Analysis Now` - Trigger immediate analysis
- `X-Fidelity: Open Settings` - Open extension settings
- `X-Fidelity: Open Reports Folder` - Open the reports directory
- `X-Fidelity: Detect Project Archetype` - Auto-detect project type
- `X-Fidelity: Show Report History` - View analysis history
- `X-Fidelity: Export Report` - Export reports in various formats
- `X-Fidelity: Show Dashboard` - Open analysis dashboard

### Configuration

The extension can be configured through VSCode settings:

```json
{
  "xfidelity.archetype": "node-fullstack",
  "xfidelity.autoAnalyzeOnSave": true,
  "xfidelity.generateReports": true,
  "xfidelity.reportFormats": ["json", "md"],
  "xfidelity.showInlineDecorations": true,
  "xfidelity.runInterval": 300
}
```

### Output Files

The extension writes analysis results to `.xfiResults/` in your workspace:

- Reports: `xfi-report-{timestamp}.json`, `xfi-report-{timestamp}.md`
- Logs: `x-fidelity.log`
- History: `.xfidelity-history.json`

### Debugging

To debug the extension:

1. Use the "Run X-Fidelity Extension" launch configuration
2. Set breakpoints in your TypeScript source files
3. The debugger will stop at breakpoints when the extension runs

### Packaging and Distribution

```bash
# Create a .vsix package
yarn package

# Install the package locally for testing
yarn install-vsix

# Publish to marketplace (requires publisher setup)
yarn publish
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
jest --watch
```

### Testing the Extension

After building, you can test the extension in several ways:

#### 1. Quick Test for Transport Issues

```bash
# Clean build and test
yarn clean && yarn build
yarn test

# If no transport errors appear, the fix is working
```

#### 2. Live Testing with VSCode

```bash
# Launch extension in debug mode
yarn dev

# Or with clean state
yarn dev:fresh
```

**What to look for:**
- Extension should activate without `Lt.transport is not a function` errors
- Check VSCode Developer Console (Help → Toggle Developer Tools)
- Look for X-Fidelity logs in Output panel
- Verify analysis runs without transport errors

#### 3. Environment Variable Verification

The extension sets `process.env.VSCODE_EXTENSION = 'true'` to help the core logger detect the VSCode environment and avoid transport issues.

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Extension won't activate | Check Developer Console, rebuild extension |
| Analysis not running | Check configuration, ensure workspace has supported project type |
| No diagnostics showing | Check Problems panel, verify `showInlineDecorations` setting |
| Reports not generating | Check file permissions, verify `reportOutputDir` setting |
| High CPU usage | Check `runInterval` setting, disable `autoAnalyzeOnFileChange` |

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `"xfidelity.debugMode": true` in your VSCode settings:

```json
{
  "xfidelity.debugMode": true,
  "xfidelity.runInterval": 0
}
```

This will:
- Enable verbose logging in the Output panel
- Disable automatic analysis (set interval to 0)
- Show detailed error messages
