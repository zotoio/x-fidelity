# VSCode Extension Issue Fixes Test

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **No Output Channel Logging**
**Problem**: Nothing was being logged in the VSCode 'X-Fidelity Analysis' Output channel

**Solution**: 
- Added `getLogger()` method to `AnalysisManager` to expose the VSCode logger
- Modified `runAnalysis` command to call `this.analysisManager.getLogger().show()` to show the output channel
- Added `xfidelity.showOutput` command for easy access to logs

**Code Changes**:
- `packages/x-fidelity-vscode/src/analysis/analysisManager.ts`: Added `getLogger()` method
- `packages/x-fidelity-vscode/src/core/extensionManager.ts`: Added logger.show() and showOutput command
- `packages/x-fidelity-vscode/package.json`: Added showOutput command definition

### 2. ✅ **Stuck Progress Indicator**
**Problem**: Constantly scrolling blue progress indicator in X-Fidelity Control Center panel

**Solution**:
- Added event listeners to `ControlCenterPanel` to listen for analysis state changes
- Panel now automatically refreshes when analysis starts/completes
- Progress indicator correctly updates from "running" to "idle"

**Code Changes**:
- `packages/x-fidelity-vscode/src/ui/panels/controlCenterPanel.ts`: 
  - Added event listeners in constructor
  - Added `refreshPanel()` method
  - Panel auto-refreshes on analysis state changes

## Test Instructions

1. **Testing Output Channel Fix**:
   - Press `F5` to launch extension
   - Run Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → "X-Fidelity: Run Analysis"
   - Output channel should automatically open and show logs
   - Alternative: Command Palette → "X-Fidelity: Show Output Channel"

2. **Testing Progress Indicator Fix**:
   - Press `F5` to launch extension  
   - Open Control Center (Activity Bar → ⚡ X-Fidelity → Control Center)
   - Click "Run Analysis" 
   - Progress indicator should show "⚡ Analyzing..." then change to "✅ Ready"
   - No more stuck spinning progress

## Verification Steps

✅ VSCode logger properly exposes show() method  
✅ Analysis commands automatically show output channel  
✅ Control Center listens to analysis state changes  
✅ Progress indicator updates correctly  
✅ All commands registered in package.json  

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- **Output Channel**: Automatically opens when analysis runs, shows detailed logs
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows real-time analysis status, resets when complete
- **User Experience**: Clear visibility into what X-Fidelity is doing

The fixes ensure users can:
- See analysis logs immediately when running analysis
- Monitor analysis progress in real-time
- Debug extension issues with proper logging
- Have confidence the extension is working correctly
