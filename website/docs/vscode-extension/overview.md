# VSCode Extension Overview

The X-Fidelity VSCode extension provides a comprehensive development experience that integrates X-Fidelity's code analysis capabilities directly into your VSCode workflow. This extension transforms X-Fidelity from a command-line tool into a fully-featured IDE integration with real-time analysis, professional UI components, and advanced debugging capabilities.
